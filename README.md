# Modern GraphQL API

## Tools used

- Pylon
  - on the backend
  - generates the gql schema from the typescript resolvers
  - [https://pylon.cronit.io/](https://pylon.cronit.io/)
    - License: Apache 2
  - uses [Hono](https://hono.dev/) for the server
    - License: MIT
  - uses [Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server) for the GraphQL
    schema integration
    - License: MIT
- Gqty
  - on the frontend
  - generates the typescript interface from the gql schema
    - this is conveniently done already during the Pylon build
  - provides a typed and user friendly way how to silently generate the gql
    query from the FE to the BE
  - [gqty.dev](https://gqty.dev/)
    - License: MIT
- Workspaces
  - The generated `gqty` folder is shared as a workspace member and is a
    dependency of the FE. Thereby accessible to possibly several frontends and
    able to use it's own dependencies and imports.
- Bun
  - js runtime [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/)
  - just for fast prototyping, could be done with node as well

## Try it yourself

```
cd api/
bun install
```

- installs all dependencies of all packages in one place

```
cd apps/backend/
bun dev
```

- builds the `backend/.pylon/schema.graphql`
- generates the `gqty` folder/package
- starts the BE dev server on http://localhost:3000
- starts the graphiql client with inspectable schema on
  http://localhost:3000/graphql
- there is also an in-build viewer on http://localhost:3000/viewer

```
cd libs/frontend/
bun dev
```

- starts the FE dev server on http://localhost:5173/

### Observe

- While you have both running, changing the return value (not the type) of a
  resolver in `backend/src/index.ts` immediately hot reloads the value on the
  frontend.
- If you add a new resolver or change a return type, after restarting the BE dev
  server, the FE in `frontend/src/App.tsx` will immediately know about the new
  shape of the API through gqty's `useQuery()` and suggest the correct API path
  and type! ü§© Isn't that cool?

## Containers

- if you have docker, just substitute `docker` for `podman`
- if you don't have either, just `sudo apt install podman` without any further
  configuration üëçÔ∏è Yes really, that is one of the benefits of podman.

- run from the root of the repo...

### Backend

```
podman build -t my-backend -f infra/backend.Dockerfile .
```

- this builds the image
- the `.` specifies the root as the context, even though the file lives in the
  infra dir
  - there is no reason to have the dockerfile in the related package dir,
    because the dependencies and the whole project structure, that is still
    required for the package build, is in the root of the repo

```
podman run -p 3000:3000 my-backend
```

- starts the container

### Frontend

```
podman build -t my-frontend -f infra/frontend.Dockerfile .
podman run -p 8080:80 my-frontend
```
